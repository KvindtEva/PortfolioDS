There is a repository of projects, which I accomplished during my Bachelor degree in HSE, Moscow.

I would specifically draw your attention the following:
- 'Building a scoring model' and 'Customer segmentation and profiling'
   - **Scoring models** and **profiling** of bank clients as part of course Data Analysis in Business
- 'Online order service'
   - **SQL database** and **chat bot** for fictional e-commerce as a part of Database Theory
- 'Thesis work'  
   - NLP project with topic modeling of scientific paper abstracts
